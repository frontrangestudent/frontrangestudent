## Hi there ðŸ‘‹Front Range Feline Developer
Just a fluffy, bug-catching tabby who enjoys purr-ogramming on sunny windowsills. When I'm not swatting at cursors, you can find me napping on warm keyboards, optimizing my zoomies, or contributing to the ongoing mystery of the red dot. My favorite frameworks include scratch posts and cardboard boxes. Always on the lookout for new features (treats) and open to pull requests (belly rubs).

Skills: HTML (Happy Tabby Markup Language), CSS (Cat Style Sheets), JavaScript (Jumping and Swatting), Agile (Agile Cat Development)

Hobbies: Debugging tangled yarn, 3 AM stand-ups, chasing laser pointers, quality assurance of catnip toys, cloud watching (from a very high perch).

Looking for: More efficient napping algorithms, open-source treat dispensers, and perhaps a new maintainer for my chin scratches.
